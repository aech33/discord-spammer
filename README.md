# INFO
It uses pyautogui and keyboard to find the message bar and then type your chosen message for the number of times you ask.

# SETUP
to install the modules you can do
-pip install pyautogui
and
-pip install keyboard
in the cmd

A screenshot of the message box is used to find it, so if your discord is in a language other than english or you have it in light mode, you'll need to do the following:
- Use Win + Shift + S to take a screenshot of *only* the bit that says 'message' (**not which channel it is**)
- Open mspaint and paste the screenshot in.
- File > Save as > **JPEG**
- Save it in the discord spammer file and call it 'msgbox.jpg' (without the quotations)
